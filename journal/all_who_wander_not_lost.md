A long sequence of events and decisions blearily stumbled over one another to lead me to where I am today - sitting on the floor, in an empty apartment, overlooking Lake Union, and typing this up for you. Some of these events were a long time coming, some were as unexpected as um, I don't know, <insert something unexpected here - godzilla?>.

This is almost the end of a crazy wind-fury of packing books and belongings, jumping between multiple Craigslist conversations at once, trying to find that optimal path between selling things and straight up giving them away. All in a mad scramble attempt to make a clean break from this life, and move on to the next.

But that's not why you're here. You're not here to listen to me whine about the crazy, non-committal people of Craigslist. You want to know about the why. You want to know what my plan is, what am I doing, what am I thinking. Well, I'll tell you right now, I have no fucking idea what I'm doing.

Yeah. I honestly don't know what I'm doing, but I suspect my gut does though. It hasn't really steered me wrong yet, and that's quite enough for me. It's a curious thing to follow your gut feeling to make a decision, isn't it? What are you really basing it on? I, for one, mostly follow my gut to avoid that sense of regret that occurs when I don't follow it. Eventually, I shift my reality to make the most of my decisions, but don't we all?

I'm planning on throwing the GPS out of the car, and just cruising around. Build some things I enjoy. Travel. See where the road takes me. I'm truly fortunate to have my family and my friends around to support me. I sure as hell don't say it enough, but thank you for your love and patience.

The why of the matter is more nebulous. And I'm not quite prepared to talk about it just yet. But I will, one of these days, as you and I get to know each other more.
