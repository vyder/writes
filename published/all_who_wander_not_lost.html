                        <p>A long sequence of events and decisions blearily stumbled over one another to lead me to where I am today - sitting on the floor, in an empty apartment, overlooking Lake Union, and typing this up for you. Some of these events were a long time coming, some were as unexpected as um, I don&#39;t know, &lt;insert something unexpected here - godzilla?&gt;.</p>
                    
                        <p>This is almost the end of a crazy wind-fury of packing books and belongings, jumping between multiple Craigslist conversations at once, trying to find that optimal path between selling things and straight up giving them away. All in a mad scramble attempt to make a clean break from this life, and move on to the next.</p>
                    
                        <p>But that&#39;s not why you&#39;re here. You&#39;re not here to listen to me whine about the crazy, non-committal people of Craigslist. You want to know about the why. You want to know what my plan is, what am I doing, what am I thinking. Well, I&#39;ll tell you right now, I have no fucking idea what I&#39;m doing.</p>
                    
                        <p>Yeah. I honestly don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing, but I suspect my gut does though. It hasn&#39;t really steered me wrong yet, and that&#39;s quite enough for me. It&#39;s a curious thing to follow your gut feeling to make a decision, isn&#39;t it? What are you really basing it on? I, for one, mostly follow my gut to avoid that sense of regret that occurs when I don&#39;t follow it. Eventually, I shift my reality to make the most of my decisions, but don&#39;t we all?</p>
                    
                        <p>I&#39;m planning on throwing the GPS out of the car, and just cruising around. Build some things I enjoy. Travel. See where the road takes me. I&#39;m truly fortunate to have my family and my friends around to support me. I sure as hell don&#39;t say it enough, but thank you for your love and patience.</p>
                    
                        <p>The why of the matter is more nebulous. And I&#39;m not quite prepared to talk about it just yet. But I will, one of these days, as you and I get to know each other more.</p>
